# ðŸ¥‡ Run your first build and test

After the initialization project, you can find an initial contract, test, and script&#x20;

```
â”œâ”€â”€ contracts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Sample.sol
â”œâ”€â”€ locklift.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 1-deploy-sample.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ giverSettings
|   â””â”€â”€ index.ts
â””â”€â”€ test
    â””â”€â”€ sample-test.ts
```

```
npx locklift build
```

After this command, your contracts will be built and you can find files such as

* Sample.abi.json
* Sample.tvc
* Sample.code
* Sample.code

### Run test

```bash
npx locklift test --network local
```

For this command need to specify the network which will be used for testing, network name should be included in the [config file](../locklift/configuration.md)
